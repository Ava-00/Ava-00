# 👋 Hi, I’m Avantika Singh and I am excited to share my journey with you!

I’m a **Data Science graduate student at Johns Hopkins University** working at the intersection of **machine learning, generative AI, and healthcare systems**. My work spans **agentic RAG systems, multimodal learning, audio deepfake detection, and large-scale EHR modeling**.

---

## 🔬 What I’m Working On

- **Audio Deepfake Detection & Bias Analysis**  
  Research at JHU CLSP (SMILE Lab) studying attacker-specific bias, generalization gaps, and robustness across ASVspoof 2019/2021/2024 and MLAAD using RawNet2, AASIST, and self-supervised speech models.

- **Healthcare AI @ Scale**  
  Building production-grade **Neural ODE survival models** on 10M+ longitudinal EHR records at Quest Diagnostics for time-to-event prediction and clinical risk stratification.

- **Agentic RAG Systems**  
  Designing **LangGraph-based RAG agents** with intent routing, evidence grounding, and structured summarization for medical and research workflows.
